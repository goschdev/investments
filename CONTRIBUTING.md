# Contributing
We welcome community support with both pull requests and reporting bugs. Please don't hesitate to jump in.

## Branch Organization
Submit all changes directly to the master branch. We donâ€™t use separate branches for development or for upcoming releases. We do our best to keep master in good shape, with all tests passing.

## Tests
All commits that fix bugs or add features need a test.

## Accessible by Default
All features need respect the WCAG.
